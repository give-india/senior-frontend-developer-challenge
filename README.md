We are looking for determined front-end developers who come with a strong experience in implementing modern web UIs that prove to be are a delight for the user. If you think you have what it takes, build us this simple app in a frontend stack of your choosing.

### Objective
Given a JS object and a JSON-patch, create a UI to
-   show the changes due to each patch operation
-   allow the user to approve / reject one patch operation at a time
-  update the UI to show the remaining operations

### What is JSON Patch?

JSON Patch is a format for describing changes to a JSON document. It can be used to store changes in the form of patch operations. The patch documents are themselves JSON documents. JSON Patch is specified in [RFC 6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) from the IETF.


### Example Scenario
**Base Object**
```js
{
"slug": "diya-foundation",
"name": "Diya Foundation",
"registration_number": "386/98-99",
"auditor_name": "Das Kumar And Company",
"created_at": "2013-02-08T09:28:51.000Z",
"updated_at": "2020-02-25T06:11:35.814Z",
"external_profiles": [{
"label": "Website",
"uri": "http://www.diyafoundation-india.org/Site/index.html"
}, {
"label": "Youtube",
"uri": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DezbmReWMf0"
}],
"tags": ["hoh18", "lfc19", "tbpp", "housie19", "gfc2020", "housie18"]
}
```

**JSON Patch**
```js
[
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/5",
        "value": "spbm18"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/4",
        "value": "bengaluru10k-18"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/3",
        "value": "lfc18-wow2"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/2",
        "value": "tcs10k-18"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/1",
        "value": "lfc18-cbp"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/tags/0",
        "value": "lfc18"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/6",
        "value": "housie18"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/7",
        "value": "hoh18"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/8",
        "value": "lfc19"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/9",
        "value": "tbpp"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/10",
        "value": "housie19"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/tags/11",
        "value": "gfc2020"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/external_profiles/1/uri",
        "value": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DIYA-Foundation/"
    },
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/external_profiles/1/label",
        "value": "Facebook"
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/external_profiles/2",
        "value": {
            "label": "Youtube",
            "uri": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DezbmReWMf0"
        }
    },
    {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/official_name",
        "value": "Diya Foundation"
    }
]
```
**Sample UI to show the differences**
Hovering on each of the change should allow the user to accept or reject the change and update the base object and the JSON patch correspondingly.
